# Clay Changelog


## Version 2.0

Complete TDD rewrite in Flask + few awesome Lucuma libraries.
Most important new features:

    - _index.html now is viewable in run mode.
    - Adaptative run port (if it is taken, Clay try to use the next one).
    - No need to filter non-html files. Only those ending in ".html" or ".tmpl" are processed as templates.
